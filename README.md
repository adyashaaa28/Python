# AI Lab Problems: Water Jug, BFS, and DFS

This repository contains classic artificial intelligence lab problems implemented in Python:
- **Water Jug Problem** (state space search)
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

## Contents

- `water_jug.py`: Solves the Water Jug Problem using state space traversal.
- `bfs.py`: Performs Breadth-First Search traversal on a graph.
- `dfs.py`: Performs Depth-First Search traversal on a graph.

## Water Jug Problem

Solves the classic AI problem: given two jugs of different capacities and an unlimited water supply, achieve a target volume using a sequence of allowed operations. Demonstrates state space representation and search strategies.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Standard graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph layer by layer. BFS is useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

Standard graph traversal algorithm going as deep as possible before backtracking. DFS is used for exploring all possible paths in a graph.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder.
3. Run any of the scripts:


Modify input inside the scripts or as prompted.

## Example Output

- Displays sequence of steps (or path) for each problem.
- Printed traversal order for BFS and DFS.
